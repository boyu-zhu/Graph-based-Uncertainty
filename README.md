## Replication Instruction
1. Make sure you've have the environment with essential libraries listed in `requirements.txt` & `vllm`

2. Launch an OpenAI-style API server using vLLM to serve the LLM
```bash
bash vllm.sh
```
3. Set the `os.environ["HF_DATASETS_CACHE"] = ''`in `main.py` line 13

4. Run the main file
```bash
python main.py
```
